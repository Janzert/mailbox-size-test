This container has an IMAP server running with a few users setup with various
size inboxes. The IMAP server is using the standard ports, unencrypted on 143
and with a self signed certificate SSL on 993. But you'll probably want to
remap those when running docker with something like '-p 10143:143' when
running the image.

The mailbox sizes and users available are:
Number of Messages    Username
1000                  u1k
10000                 u10k
100000                u100k
1000000               u1000k

Password for all users is 'test'.

Any domain name can be used or completely left out (e.g. u1k or
u1k@test.domain), This can be used to create multiple accounts with the same
number of messages on a client.
